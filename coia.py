# WHY THERE IS NOTHING TO LOCALIZE. Native-speaker review, 2026-08-25, 47
# independent reviews across 11 languages and 7 models from 5 labs. Two findings
# collapsed the appendix that used to live here:
#
# 1. Bare apposition was proposed independently in EVERY language. A connector
#    is what forces a template to know things it cannot know -- grammatical
#    gender of an organization it has never seen, the case a preposition
#    governs, whether an article contracts, which allomorph a particle takes.
#    Drop the connector and every one of those problems is not solved but
#    dissolved. An alias is a business card, not a sentence, and a bare noun
#    sequence is the business-card register in all eleven.
# 2. The order is who-role-scope, unanimously, in 8 of the 11 (33 reviews, no
#    dissent) and in 35 of all 47. Only ja, ko and zh dissent, and they do not
#    agree with each other -- ja proposes scope-role-who, ko scope-who-role, zh
#    has no majority at all across 8 reviews while still putting who first in 5
#    of them. A 2-of-3 split that its own neighbours contradict is weak evidence
#    against 33 unanimous reviews.
#
# The cost is honest and small: ja and ko get an order their speakers rated
# second-best. Against that, the label is private, search is order-independent
# (see `matches`), and its only reader already knows what it means.
#
# WHAT USED TO BE HERE, so it is not rediscovered as a missing feature:
#   - Korean -(으)로서 allomorphy (로서 after a vowel or ㄹ, else 으로서). The rule
#     was CORRECT; a reviewer confirmed it against the examples. It went with the
#     particle it served.
#   - Russian в/во before certain consonant clusters. Already dead before this
#     change -- apposition had removed its only call site.
#   - Per-language connectors: en `as`/`at`, es `como`, de `als`, fr `comme`,
#     pt `como`, it `come`/`presso`, ru `как`, ja `の`/`として`/`での`, ar `بصفة`/`في`,
#     he `בתפקיד`/`ב`, zh `作为`/`在`.
# Reintroducing any of them means reintroducing a reason for a connector.
